 

Heat transfer is the movement of thermal energy from one body or system to another due to a temperature difference. There are **three main modes** of heat transfer.

### ðŸ“Š Modes of Heat Transfer:

1. **Conduction:**  
   - Transfer of heat through a solid material.  
   - Governed by **Fourierâ€™s Law**:  
    
     q = -k $\frac{dT}{dx}$
        where \( q \) is heat flux, \( k \) is thermal conductivity, and ( $\frac{dT}{dx}$) is the temperature gradient.

2. **Convection:**  
   - Heat transfer via fluid motion (liquids or gases).  
   - Equation:  
    Q = hA($T_{\text{surface}}$ - $T_{\text{fluid}}$)
     where \( h \) is the convection coefficient, \( A \) is surface area.

3. **Radiation:**  
   - Emission of energy as electromagnetic waves.  
   - Given by **Stefanâ€“Boltzmann Law**:  
     $Q = \sigma A T^4$  
     where ( $\sigma$ ) is the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann constant, ( A ) is surface area, ( T ) is absolute temperature.

### ðŸ§® Additional Equations:

- **Sensible heat:**  
  $Q = mc\Delta T$
  where ( m ) is mass, ( c ) is specific heat capacity, ( $\Delta T$) is temperature change.
