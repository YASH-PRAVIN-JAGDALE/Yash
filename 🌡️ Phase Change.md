 
Phase change refers to the transformation of a substance from one state of matter to another — like solid to liquid, or liquid to gas — without a change in chemical composition.

### 🧊 Common Phase Transitions:
- **Melting (Fusion):** Solid → Liquid
- **Freezing:** Liquid → Solid
- **Evaporation (Vaporization):** Liquid → Gas
- **Condensation:** Gas → Liquid
- **Sublimation:** Solid → Gas
- **Deposition:** Gas → Solid

### 💡 Thermodynamic Considerations:
- **During phase change**, temperature remains constant.
- **Latent heat** is absorbed or released without changing the temperature.
- Example: Ice melting at 0°C absorbs heat, but stays at 0°C until fully melted.

### 📐 Key Equation:

$\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H_{phase}}{T}$


Where:
- $\Delta H_{phase}$ = Enthalpy of fusion or vaporization
- T = Temperature in Kelvin
